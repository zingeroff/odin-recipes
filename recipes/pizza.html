    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="img/pizza.jpeg" alt="Pizza" />
    <p>
      Here is the archetype of a thin-crust pizza pie, a pizza margherita
      adorned simply in the colors of the Italian flag: green from basil, white
      from mozzarella, red from tomato sauce. This pizza is adapted from the
      recipe used by the staff at Robertas restaurant in Brooklyn, who make
      their tomato sauce simply by whizzing together canned tomatoes, a drizzle
      of olive oil and a pinch of salt. The ingredients offer in their
      proportions what appears to be a kind of austerity — not even 3 ounces of
      cheese! But the result is home-cooked pizza to beat the band, exactly the
      sort of recipe to start a career in home pizza-making, and to return to
      again and again

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 12-inch round of pizza dough, stretched</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2¾ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
      <li>4 to 5basil leaves, roughly torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn
        heat to its highest setting. Let it heat for at least an hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the sauce in the center of the stretched dough and use the back of a
        spoon to spread it evenly across the surface, stopping approximately ½
        inch from the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle a little olive oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large
        pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Scatter basil leaves over
        the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated stone
        or tiles in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the
        cheese is bubbling, approximately 4 to 8 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tip</h3>
    <h4>
      <em>
        In a food processor, whiz together whole, drained canned tomatoes, a
        splash of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Keep leftover sauce
        refrigerated.
